# Airflow System Tests

Files that allows to run [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/) system tests.
They are executed in **Google Cloud Build** by [Airflow Breeze](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst).

## Setting up environment

  ### 1. Preparing Google Cloud Project

  Instruction how create Google Cloud Project for system tests is available in `airflow-providers-google-setup` folder.
  See instructions: [airflow-providers-google-setup/README.md](airflow-providers-google-setup/README.md)

  ### 2. Modify files

  Modify following files:
   - `system_tests/cloudbuild.yaml` - so `_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS_GCS_BUCKET` will point to bucket with service accounts.
      It is created in the previous step (output of `terraform apply` command prints bucket name `service_account_bucket_name`).
   - `system_tests/cloudbuild.yaml` - so `LOGS_GCS_BUCKET` will point to bucket where Cloud Build logs will be uploaded.
      It is created in the previous step (output of `terraform apply` command prints bucket name `cloud_build_logs_bucket_name`).
   - `scripts/list_of_tests.sh` - comment / uncomment out tests which are / are not intended to run.

  ### 3. Build docker image to run Breeze

  In `airflow_system_tests_env_image` folder is located `Dockerfile` which describes environment to run Breeze
  (see [Breeze prerequisites](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst#prerequisites)).

  To build image and push it to GCR:

  ```shell
  cd airflow_system_tests_env_image
  gcloud builds submit .
  ```

  Docker image will be available at `gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/airflow-system-tests-env:latest`.

## Running tests

  ### Run multiple system tests whitelisted in `scripts/list_of_tests.sh`

  They will be executed by default on `apache/airflow` repository on `master` branch

  ```shell
  gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild_system_tests.yaml
  ```

  Command to list all triggered builds will be in the last line of the log, e.g.:
  ```shell
  List runs with command:

  gcloud builds list --filter "tags='trigger-fdb3a03b-1f99-45fa-8dcb-5cf4d6ca3828'" --format="table[box,margin=3,title='system tests'](id,status,tags,logUrl)"
  ```

  ### Run single system test

  It will be executed by default on `apache/airflow` repository on `master` branch.

  ```shell
  bash scripts/run_single_system_test.sh tests/providers/google/cloud/operators/test_speech_to_text_system.py
  ```

  ### Run any command in Breeze environment

  Example of the command to run Google Memorystore system tests on the Airflow fork and non-default branch.

  ```shell
  export CMD="./breeze tests --verbose --backend=postgres tests/providers/google/cloud/operators/test_cloud_memorystore_system.py -- -s --system=google"
  export AIRFLOW_REPO="https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow"
  export BRANCH="fix-to-issue-8286-cloud-memorystore-memcached-operators"

  cd system_tests
  gcloud builds submit \
      --timeout=3600 \
      --substitutions _CMD="${CMD}",_AIRFLOW_REPO="${AIRFLOW_REPO}",_BRANCH="${BRANCH}"
  ```

  Setting `--timeout` for system tests is recommended.

## Google Cloud Build configuration to run Breeze

Configuration is located in `system_tests` folder. It supports following substitutions:

| Substitution                   | Default value                                                                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
